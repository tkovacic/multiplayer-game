          |I have always had an interest in technology, which started at the age of nine when my dad purchased Dark Visual Basic IDE and a manual for me to experiment. In High School I took introduction technology classes learning about the anatomy and repair of hardware as well as simple visual basic programming. I graduated from Purdue University in 2016 with a bachelors in Computer Networking and Information Technology with a concentration in Information Technology Systems.  I still retain this passion for working with computers and love being able to architect a project at my desk. I am a self-driven employee who enjoys the tiniest details of a project rather than just a slice of the big picture. Projects that involve something new and offer a learning experience to me are the projects that excite me the most. Currently I write Perl, CSS, HTML, JS/JQuery, and SQL to develop and provide front end and back end support for Ford's Network Operations Automation Tools.
